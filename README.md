# java-zoo-project

A Java Terminal Zoo Admin Panel with Basic Functionalities.

This project showcases object-oriented programming principles such as abstract classes, interfaces, encapsulation, inheritance, and data structures such as array lists. It also demonstrates algorithmic traversals and serialization, where each new animal added by the zoo admin is serialized and saved for next time. The terminal interface displays ASCII animal models. The program provides basic functionalities such as search, edit, add, and delete, with options to search by ID, name, etc.

Note: The ASCII animal models used in this program are created by artists and used only for personal and educational reasons.
