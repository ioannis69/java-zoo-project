This project show off the object-oriented programming structure (abstract classes, interfaces, encapsulation, inheritance etc.), data structures and algorithmic traversals of them (array lists) and serialiazation (each new animal added by the zoo admin is serialized in order to be saved for next time). Furthermore, it features ASCII showing animal forms in terminal. Moreover, it contains basic functionalities (search, edit, add, delete), some of which in differnet forms (byId, byName etc.)


note: The ASCII models are made by artists they are not mine (used for personal and educational reason only).
